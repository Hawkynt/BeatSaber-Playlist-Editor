## 💻 Compatibility

This tool is designed to work with Beat Saber installations on PC (e.g., Steam, Oculus) and can manage playlists that are also used on Quest.

## 🏛️ Architecture

This project demonstrates a unique approach by applying the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** pattern to a **Windows Forms** application. While typically associated with newer frameworks like WPF and MAUI, this architectural choice brings several key benefits:

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The UI (View) is decoupled from the application logic (ViewModel), leading to a cleaner and more organized codebase.
*   **Enhanced Testability:** With the logic isolated in the ViewModel, it can be unit-tested independently of the UI, ensuring greater stability and reliability.
*   **Improved Maintainability:** This separation makes the project easier to understand, debug, and extend over time.

It serves as an interesting case study for applying modern design patterns to classic UI frameworks.
